This project is to create a system for hospitals to arrange the appointments for medical professions. The system has all the records of nurses and doctors and their affiliated departments. Also, it stores all the information of the time and the location of consultations and surgeries. Doctors and nurses can apply this system to record the time and venue arrangement of their appointments, meanwhile patients may use the system to check the availability of the medical personnel.
